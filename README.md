TM-Simulator
============

This project was done for my Theory of Computation class in the Fall of 2013.

============================================================================================================

The simulator reads in a text file that contains the information for a Turing Machine diagram and stores it.

You can then feed the machine a string based on the language you provided and the program will tell you
whether or not the Turing Machine accepted or rejected the string.
